This plugin imports raw HTML forms into Gravity Forms
== Description ==
Better Raw HTML Form Importer will give you a list of all inputs displayed in a table with editable label, name and value

Users can then sort the forms and import to Gravity Forms for further editing

IMPORTANT: This tool will not do a perfect import which is why you are able to edit before importing into gravity forms.
The idea here is to save time when trying to move old, raw HTML forms into Gravity Forms instead of retyping and
rebuilding all your form elements from scratch.

Simply upload the plugin to to your wp-content/plugins directory and activate.
